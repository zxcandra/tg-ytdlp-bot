‚Ä¢ If you want to download youtube playlist give a range like this: 
__separate the --link--, --start-- and --end-- playlist index numbers in `*` mark.__

    `https://blabla.blaa*1*4` 

__this will download all videos from --index 1-- to --index 4-- on that playlist.__


‚Ä¢ If you need a coustom playlist name send like this:

    `https://blabla.blaa*1*4*coustom name`

‚Ä¢ __If you want to change the caption of a video reply to the video with your caption.__ **Bot will send your video with your caption.**

‚Ä¢ To clean your working space send /clean command. If you get any download errors, you can try this out. Then send the link again. It will fix the issue.

‚Ä¢ You can also download any private video with a cookie file. Just send your cookies.txt file to the bot.

‚Ä¢ To check the cookie file run /check_cookie command. After setting the cookie file, you can enter your video url as usual. If you need to download private playlist it will also work as usual.

‚Ä¢ To see your logs and your usage, send /usage command.
